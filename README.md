# Vitamin-Deficiency-Detection-using-image-Processing
This repository presents a deep learning pipeline that identifies potential vitamin deficiencies from medical images of the skin, nails, hair, and tongue. It classifies visible signs into 32 medical conditions, and maps each to related nutritional deficiencies and dietary recommendations.

A machine learning-based model that detects potential vitamin deficiencies using images of skin, hair, nails, and tongue. It leverages MobileNetV2, image preprocessing, and TensorFlow to classify deficiencies with high accuracy.
